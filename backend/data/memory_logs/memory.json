        "respectively. For our equation, this means that the sum of the roots is $k + 2$, and the product of the roots is $k$.",
        "Now, we know that the roots must lie between 1 and 3. This means that:",
        "$$1 \\leq r_1, r_2 \\leq 3,$$",
        "where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the two roots of the equation.",
        "Using Vieta's formulas, we can write:",
        "$$\\frac{k + 2}{1} \\geq r_1 + r_2 \\geq \\frac{k + 2}{1}$$",
        "and",
        "$$k \\leq r_1r_2 \\leq k.$$",
        "However, these inequalities don't provide the range of values of $k$. But we can use the fact that the roots are real and lie between 1 and 3 to get more information about $k$.",
        "Since the roots must be real (by assumption), we have:",
        "$$(k + 2)^2 - 4k \\geq 0$$",
        "Simplifying this inequality gives us:",
        "$$k^2 - k \\leq 0.$$",
        "This is a quadratic inequality, which can be factored as:",
        "$$k(k-1) \\leq 0.$$",
        "The solutions to this inequality are $0 \\leq k \\leq 1$.",
        "Therefore, the range of values for $k$ such that the roots of the equation lie between 1 and 3 is $[0, 1]$."
